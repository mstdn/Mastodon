/*
Hide buttons that can't be clicked
- columns on /about and tag pages have buttons that don't work.
- so, this snippet hides those nonworking buttons to save space
- and to avoid confusion.
- unboostable buttons are made transparent on hover instead.

this is fixed in https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/10054
